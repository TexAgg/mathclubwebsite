# Math Club
This is the repository for Texas A&M's Math Club.
At the moment the site is hosted [here](https://peaceful-atoll-84937.herokuapp.com/) but it will be moved in the future.

## Instructions
If you are a future webmaster, and don't know any PHP or HTML, fear not.
I have tried to make the website fairly easy to update.
All information that is likely to change is stored 
in one of the CSV (Comma-Seperated Values) files
in the `resources` folder.
There, you can update the current officers, 
the images on the homepage of the website,
or any organizations by editing either
`officers.csv`, `homeImages.csv`, or `organizations.csv`, respectively.

For the Bi-weekly Math Contest, I plan on posting the problems [here](http://mathclubtamu.blogspot.com/),
and the website will update itself automatically whenever a new post is made.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at [matt.gaikema@tamu.edu](mailto:matt.gaikema@tamu.edu).
