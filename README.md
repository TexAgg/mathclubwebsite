# Math Club
This is the repository for Texas A&M's Math Club.
At the moment the site is hosted [here](https://peaceful-atoll-84937.herokuapp.com/) but it will be moved in the future.

## Instructions
If you are a future webmaster, and don't know any PHP or HTML, fear not.
I have tried to make the website fairly easy to update.
All information that is likely to change is stored 
in one of the CSV (Comma-Seperated Values) files
in the `resources` folder.
There, you can update the current officers, 
the images on the homepage of the website,
or any organizations by editing either
`officers.csv`, `homeImages.csv`, or `organizations.csv`, respectively.
Various resources are saved in [this](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwjQwHPO5djrc1pvVFlxOUR4V3M&usp=sharing)
Google folder.

### Calendar
The calendar is found [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=4kl90qkd5vdkrr2pm2f0np8tk0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Chicago).
It should be shared, along with the [math contest blog](http://mathclubtamu.blogspot.com/), with the other officers.
However, since your title is also Communications Officer, you are responsible for updating events and informing others.

### Bi-Weekly Math Contest
For the Bi-weekly Math Contest, I plan on posting the problems [here](http://mathclubtamu.blogspot.com/),
and the website will update itself automatically whenever a new post is made.

### Version Control
If you aren't familiar with [git](https://git-scm.com/), skip this.
The git repository for this website is [here](https://bitbucket.org/tamumathclub/website/overview).

### Further Questions
If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at [matt.gaikema@tamu.edu](mailto:matt.gaikema@tamu.edu).
